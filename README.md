#### disclaimer
  The app full development time was aprox 3-4 hours and had to find ways to simplify the app and not to over engineer it. taking note that the app is not a production app and is just a task for SiTech. the main focus was to show the main functionality and the design of the app. rather than the code quality and the architecture of the app. while taking into consideration not to under engineer the app and make it lack performance and not to be able to scale.
